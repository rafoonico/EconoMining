# EconoMining
Text mining thecniques applied in economic literature.

This project aims to provide some templates for using text mining in economic literature. At a first glance, it's seems that the economy subject should not be specified in the project, due to the fact that the thecniques here shown can be used in any other kind of literature. Nonetheless, this kind of approach will be helpful for gathering a specific public (e.g: researchers in economics), who can provide thoroughly feedbacks and thoughts for attending that specific field of knowledge.

At the beginning, I'll only use R but I'm willing to work with Python and JS (in the future) too. Anyway, if there are two or more languages, I assure you that I will separate into different folds so the users will not have to deal with a messy repository... hehehe.

## Wordclouds for Adam Smith's "Wealth of the Nations"

This project used an webscrapping followed by an wordcloud. The link source is "https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html?chapter_num=8#book-reader", and the task was build under a shiny app avaliable in the repository.
